# Advent of Code 2023

These are my modest Rust contributions to the Advent of Code 2023.

## How to start a new puzzle

To start day 16, do this:

```shell
$ ./make_day 16
```

After that, a new directory template is created at `./day16`. Input and examples have to be downloaded manually.

## How to run

To run day 3, part 2 do this:

```shell
$ ./run day03_part2 day03/input
```
